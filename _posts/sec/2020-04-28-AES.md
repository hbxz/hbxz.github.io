### challenge

The lecture team have build an encryption utility that can encode your messages in real-time using military grade AES encryption. 

Use your knowledge of the **block cipher modes** to determine which mode of encryption was used for which message. [Try here](http://comp6445-curlybracket-letsmakeflagsgreatagain-curlybracket.bid/challenges/blockmodes/index.html) 

### History

The modern era of cryptography began in the 70s when the National Bureau of Standards put out a call for a free and public encryption standard. The result was DES - the Data Encryption Standard. The NSA made some tweaks at the time, [which we did understand the impact of until two decades later](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/10/the_legacy_of_d.html). 

By the 90s DES was considered crackable due to its relatively small 56-bit key, and it was quite slow to run in software, so a search for a [replacement algorithm began](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard_process). Many algorithms were submitted, but the winning cipher was one known as *Rijndael*. 

Read the [history of modern ciphers comic](http://www.moserware.com/2009/09/stick-figure-guide-to-advanced.html), including DES and how AES works.

### Block Cipher Modes

You should be aware that DES and AES are forms of what is known as a 'block cipher'. This means that for a plain text, they can only encrypt a fixed amount of the file at a time. Look up the DES spec and you will find that it only accepts **64** bits of a plain text at a time; AES supports only **128** bits. This is known as a **cipher's block size**, and which is why these types of ciphers are known as **block ciphers**. 

Obviously most files are larger than 128 bits so we need to come up with a way to divide a file into 128 size blocks and encrypt them all. This process is described as **block cipher modes**. 

#### ECB - Electronic Code Book

>   Flaw: no Avalanche Effect

You may be thinking - why not just divide the file up into chucks of 128 bits and encrypt them separately? This is possible, and is known as the ***Electronic Code Book*** mode of encryption.

However ECB has a serious **flaw**. Just like we observed the weaknesses in monoalphabetic substitution ciphers in the early weeks of the course, ECB suffers from the problem that the same input will encode to the same output. Making analysis trivial. 

See this famous picture of Tux the Linux penguin encrypted using AES, but using the Electronic Code Book mode of encryption. It's for this reason that ECB is NOT recommended for encryption, and serves as a perfect example of how security can be complex to get right - even the current standard of encryption can be rendered superfluous if used incorrectly.

#### CBC - Cipher Block Chaining

>   Provides Avalanche Effect but slow, not parallelizable. 

Cipher block chaining attempts to solve the problem of the same blocks resulting in the same cipher text by incorporating the past block in each subsequent block. In that way each block is a result of all the blocks before it. 

![image-20200428214701569](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbxz/picture-storage/master/2020/04/image-20200428214701569.png)

Since the first block does not have a previous block to include, we use something called an initialisation vector - which is just a. random value which is transferred in the clear alongside the first block. 

This prevents the problem that occurs with ECB but unfortunately it makes encrypting things very slow as **it is no longer parallelizable** - we need to wait for the previous block to be encrypted before we can start on the next block. 

#### CTR - Counter Mode

Counter mode is a bit of a unique mode of encryption that flips most other modes on their heads! Counter mode turns the AES block cipher into a pseudo-stream cipher. **Instead of encrypting the plain text**, CTR mode encrypts a random **NONCE and counter value**. For each subsequent block, the counter value is increased, and thanks to the confusion and diffusion properties of AES, a very small change in the plaintext results in a massive change to the cipher text. 

This long string of pseudorandom bits is treated like a stream cipher - the actual plaintext is XORed with the output of the encryption of the NONCE and counter, and the real cipher is the result of the XOR operation.
